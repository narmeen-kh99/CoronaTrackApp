# summry:
This applaction is a part from my education - Software Enginerring Course
The goal of the aplaction is to develop an information system for managing the follow-up of corona patients in Israel.
The system will allow a nurse in the Ministry of Health to add verified patients and document an interview with them. During the interview, the nurse will enter the patient's details. And also an option to enter the route that the patient did. At each stop on the route, the nurse will enter the date and time and the name of the site / address visited by the patient and a list of suspects of infection and the system will indicate that they have been in isolation for 14 days.
And the system will allow the nurse to view all contagion suspects who have not yet been contacted and then contact them and complete their details as in the process of entering verified patient details.
The system will also allow a laboratory technician to enter a test result on patients or suspects in the system.
Any suspect whose test is positive will be included in the list of patients to be interviewed so that the nurse can contact them.
The system also presents statistics on patients in Israel.
